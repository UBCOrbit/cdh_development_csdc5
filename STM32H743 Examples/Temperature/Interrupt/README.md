# Temperature Sensor Example - Interrupt

The following example displays how to use the temperature sensor on the STM32H743. The temperature sensor is accessed through ADC3 on channel 18.

This program starts off by printing the calibration values of the temperature sensor at 30C and 110C. It then starts off a continuous ADC conversion that runs in the background which updates the values of the sensor data and calculated temperature each time it finishes and calls the callback function. The main body is a loop that continually prints the value of the sensor data and temperature variables.

The clock rate and sampling cycles must be selected such that the sampling time is greater than the minimum sampling time for the ADC (9Âµs). 

## ADC Initialization Settings
* **`hadc3.Instance`**: Defines the register base address. Set to `ADC3` to access the temperature sensor.
* **`hadc3.Init.ClockPrescaler`**: Defines the clock source and prescaling to be used for the ADC.
* **`hadc3.Init.BoostMode`**: Must be `ENABLED` if the ADC clock rate is >= 20 MHz. It should be set automatically by STM32CubeMX when configuring the clock rate.
* **'hadc3.Init.ContinuousConvMode'**: Set to `ENABLE` to perform conversions in continuous mode.

* **`HAL_ADC_Init(&hadc3)`**: Initializes the ADC peripheral.

## Channel Configuration

* **`sConfig.Channel`**: Selects the channel. Set to `ADC_CHANNEL_TEMPSENSOR` (channel 18).
* **`sConfig.SamplingTime`**: Defines the number of sampling cycles. Options enumerated in STM32CubeMX or in `stm32h7xx_hal_adc_ex.h`.

* **`HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel(&hadc3, &sConfig)`**: Configures the channel.
* **`HAL_ADCEx_Calibration_Start(&hadc3, ADC_CALIB_OFFSET, ADC_SINGLE_ENDED)`**: Performs an ADC automatic self-calibration.
