Independent WatchDog Timer as a FreeRTOS task
Design Idea: Have one highest priority task that refreshes the WD after doing a health check of all the remaining lower priority tasks. This task will consequently be blocked for a while just a bit shorter than the max timeout value of the WD timer, which will set via the prescaler and the MCU clock frequency, depending on how long each of our tasks will take. The WD task must be blocked vTaskDelayUntil(), rather than vTaskDelay(), because we want to return to this task precisely x seconds later, independent of whatever unexpected delay might occur inside of other lower priority tasks.
